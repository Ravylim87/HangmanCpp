# Overview

Hangman is a game to test your knowledge about vocabularies. The words will be chosen by the computer for the player to guess. There will be a dash for each letter in the words to give the player a hint about the number of the letters in the words. The player has to guess the words right before they miss them six times to win the game. However, if the player misses six shots, they will lose the game. Hangman is a fun game for people of all ages, and while playing it, they can improve their vocabulary.

# Future Work

A list of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.

- Add more words to the games
- Add point to the game
- Add levels to the game, and the game will get harder and harder the more players get a lot of words correct.
- Instead of giving the user a hint in the form of a letter, we could draw them a picture instead.
